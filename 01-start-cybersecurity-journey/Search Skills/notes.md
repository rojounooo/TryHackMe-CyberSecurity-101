### üì¶ Task 2: Evaluation of Search Results
**Concepts Covered**:
- Things to consider:
    - Source:
        - Is the author or organization reputable and are they authoritative on the matter, just publishing a blog doesn't make an author reputable
    - Evidence and reasoning:
        - Are the claims logical? Are they backed by evidence? Hard facts are needed, this can include citations or reports.
    - Objectivity and Bias:
        - Is the author biased, do they only provide one perspective or multiple?
    - Corroboration and Consistency:
        - Check multiple sources for similar claims, the first source is not a "be all end all"

**My Notes**:
```
This task just provides a checklist for identifying whether a source is reliable or not.
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Task 3: Search Engines
**Concepts Covered**:
- Search Operators used by Google 
    - "exact phrase": Double quotes to indicate you are looking for pages with that exact phrase, results will only include pages with the phrase in it
    - site: Filters by domain name 
    - "-": The minus symbol removes results with a specific word or phrase
    - filetype: Only returns results with the specified filetype

**My Notes**:
```
Goes over the operators to get more filtered results, this is useful for both OSINT and just general web searching
```
### ‚öôÔ∏è Task 4: Specialized Search Engines
**Concepts Covered**:
- **Shodan** - Search Engine for devices and systems connected to the internet like servers and IoT devices
- **Censys** - Search engine for hosts, website and certificates
- **VirusTotal** - Online virus scanning service
- **Have I Been Pwned** - Database to check whether email or password has been in recent leaked data breaches

**My Notes**:
```
Useful when checking for specific services. It can also be used for potential phishing emails, if a document has been provided it can be run through VirusTotal.
```
