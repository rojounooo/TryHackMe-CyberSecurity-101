### 📦 Task 2: Evaluation of Search Results
**Concepts Covered**:
- Things to consider:
    - Source:
        - Is the author or organization reputable and are they authoritative on the matter, just publishing a blog doesn't make an author reputable
    - Evidence and reasoning:
        - Are the claims logical? Are they backed by evidence? Hard facts are needed, this can include citations or reports.
    - Objectivity and Bias:
        - Is the author biased, do they only provide one perspective or multiple?
    - Corroboration and Consistency:
        - Check multiple sources for similar claims, the first source is not a "be all end all"

**My Notes**:
```
This task just provides a checklist for identifying whether a source is reliable or not.
