## 🧾 Section Summaries

### 📦 Task 2: Evaluation of Search Results
**Concepts Covered**:
- Things to consider:
    - Source:
        - Is the author or organization reputable and are they authoritative on the matter, just publishing a blog doesn't make an author reputable
    - Evidence and reasoning:
        - Are the claims logical? Are they backed by evidence? Hard facts are needed, this can include citations or reports.
    - Objectivity and Bias:
        - Is the author biased, do they only provide one perspective or multiple?
    - Corroboration and Consistency:
        - Check multiple sources for similar claims, the first source is not a "be all end all"

### ⚙️ Task 3: Search Engines
**Concepts Covered**:
- Search Operators used by Google 
    - "exact phrase": Double quotes to indicate you are looking for pages with that exact phrase, results will only include pages with the phrase in it
    - site: Filters by domain name 
    - "-": The minus symbol removes results with a specific word or phrase
    - filetype: Only returns results with the specified filetype

### ⚙️ Task 4: Specialized Search Engines
**Concepts Covered**:
- **Shodan** - Search Engine for devices and systems connected to the internet like servers and IoT devices
- **Censys** - Search engine for hosts, website and certificates
- **VirusTotal** - Online virus scanning service
- **Have I Been Pwned** - Database to check whether email or password has been in recent leaked data breaches

### ⚙️ Task 5: Vulnerabilities and Exploits
**Concepts Covered**:
- **CVE**:
    - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
    - The program is like a dictionary of vulnerabilities
    - Standardized ID for vulnerabilites and issues in software and hardware products
    - Each is assigned a CVE ID with the following format `CVE-YEAR-XXXXX`
    - MITRE maintain the **CVE** program, there is a <a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE Program </a> website and the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database </a> (**NVD**) website

- Exploit Database (**Exploit DB**)
    - Do not attempt exploitable unless given permission (usually via a legal contract) 
    - Exploit DB contains exploit codes from various authors for different vulnerabilities
    - Some are tested and verified
    - Exploit Database has a <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/"> website </a> and there is also a terminal tool known as searchsploit

- **GitHub**
    - A web-based platform for software developers
    - Contains many CVE related tools, with proof-of-concept and exploit codes

### ⚙️ Task 6: Technical Documentation
**Concepts Covered**:
- **Linux Manual Pages**
    - "man" for short 
    - `man {command}` to get the manual pages on linux, can also search for them in a browser 
    - man pages contain detailed information about the cool, flags and how to use them

- **Microsoft Windows**
    - 
    - 
    - 

### ⚙️ Task 7: Search Engines
**Concepts Covered**:
- Bullet points of key concepts
