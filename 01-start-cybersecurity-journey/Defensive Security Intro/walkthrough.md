### üß© Task [3]: Practical Example of Defensive Security

- Check if IP address is malicious or suspicious 
- Confirmed malicious IP address
- Escalate to SOC Team Lead
- Block IP address
- Get Flag

**Explanation:**
```
By taking note of the malicious IP address we can block future packets arriving from it 
We escalate to SOC lead to determine which steps we need to take next 
Blocking the IP Address prevents further packets, the firewall will check the SRC address to determine whether to drop the packet or not
```
