## 🧾 Section Summaries

### ⚙️ Task 2: Background
**Concepts Covered**:
- Lightweight OS 
- Very common just not for PCs or Desktops
    - e.g:
        - Websites 
        - Control Panels 
        - Checkout tills 
        - Critical Infrastructure
- Linux is an umbrella term for UNIX based OSes
- Many distributions/versions of Linux

### ⚙️ Task 4: Running commands
**Concepts Covered**:
- Many lightweight systems don't have a GUI so a terminal is used instead 
- Terminal is text based
- `echo` just outputs any text
- `whoami` outputs logged in username

### ⚙️ Task 5: Interacting with FIle System
**Concepts Covered**:
- `ls` listing directories or files
- `cd` change directory
- `cat` concatenate (outputs file contents)
- `pwd` prints working directory e.g /home

### ⚙️ Task 6: Searching for Files
**Concepts Covered**:
- `find` used to search for files based on name or ext
- `grep` used to filter searches or only output a certain pattern from files

### ⚙️ Task 7: Shell Operators
**Concepts Covered**:
- `&` run commands in the background
- `&&` combine commands
- `>` redirect output from one command to a file 
- `>>` append output of a command to a file

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Linux is so useful because it barely requires resources
- It's open source so can be freely edited
