## 📚 About the Cyber Security 101 Path

The **Cyber Security 101** path on TryHackMe is designed to introduce the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity. It includes interactive, beginner-friendly modules that cover topics such as:

- Basic Linux and networking concepts  
- Cyber hygiene and defensive security  
- Introduction to offensive security  
- Practical, hands-on labs to reinforce skills  

I am using this path as a stepping stone into the broader field of cyber security, aiming to build a strong foundational understanding.
